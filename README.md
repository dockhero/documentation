# Introduction

Dockhero is an add-on which turns any Docker image into a microservice attached to your Heroku app

If you think of Heroku add-ons in general as of boxes with some useful mechanisms inside \(like databases, log analyzers, messengers etc.\), then Dockhero is an empty box where you can put your own mechanism described by [docker-compose.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).
